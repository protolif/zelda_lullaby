###About:
This is supposed to be an 8-bit 'cover' of Zelda's Lullaby, from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, on the N64 system.

###Credits:
Obviously, Zelda and N64 are copyright Nintendo. I'm just playing around with Bloopsaphone here, trying to be creative. Bloopsaphone was created by why the lucky stiff. Thanks _Why, wherever you are.

###Installing:
Bloopsaphone requires something called PortAudio to be installed on your system, in order to hear stuff. Mac users can set this up pretty easily with homebrew (E.g. brew install portaudio). Unix/Linux users can grab the tarball and compile in /usr/local, but I'm sure you already knew that. Windows users can [grab the dll](http://bit.ly/A1CTDi), and put it somewhere in your path (E.g. system32)
